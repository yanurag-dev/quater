# Security

This page documents Quater's security boundaries, defaults, and the places where
your application owns the policy.

## Prerequisites

Read [Quickstart](/en/dev/quickstart), [Actions and CLI](/en/dev/actions),
and [MCP](/en/dev/mcp) if your app exposes tools or actions.

## Security Model

Quater checks unsafe request properties before user code runs. Auth then runs at
the surface and route levels.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    request["framework: request enters"]
    checks["framework: host, body size, forwarded headers, CORS, MCP origin"]
    api["HTTP route"]
    mcp["MCP tool"]
    cli["CLI action"]
    mcpauth["your code: mcp_auth"]
    cliauth["your code: cli_auth"]
    routeauth["your code: auth="]
    approval["your code: approval hook"]
    handler["your code: handler"]

    request --> checks
    checks --> api --> routeauth --> handler
    checks --> mcp --> mcpauth --> routeauth --> approval --> handler
    checks --> cli --> cliauth --> routeauth --> approval --> handler
```

Quater does not ship a user system. Your auth hooks decide who the caller is and
what scopes they have.

## Auth

An auth hook receives `AuthRequest` and returns `AuthContext` or `None`:

```python
from quater import AuthContext, AuthRequest, Quater, Request


async def authenticate(ctx: AuthRequest) -> AuthContext | None:
    if ctx.headers.get("authorization") != "Bearer demo-token":
        return None
    return AuthContext(subject="user_123", metadata={"scope": "orders:read"})


app = Quater()


@app.get("/me", auth=authenticate)
async def me(request: Request) -> dict[str, str]:
    assert request.auth is not None
    return {"subject": request.auth.subject}
```

Missing or rejected auth returns:

```text
401 Unauthorized
Unauthorized
```

Routes without `auth=` are public HTTP routes. If the route also has
`tool=True`, MCP still requires `mcp_auth` at the transport layer. If the route
also has `cli=True`, CLI still requires `cli_auth`.

::: warning Protect the handler, not only the surface
Surface auth protects MCP or CLI entrypoints. It does not protect the normal
HTTP endpoint for the same route. Add route `auth=` or group `auth=` for every
sensitive handler.
:::

## Surface Auth

`mcp_auth` protects:

- `POST /mcp`
- `GET /mcp/docs`
- `initialize`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`

`cli_auth` protects:

- local action discovery
- local action execution
- `GET /.well-known/quater-actions.json`
- `POST /__quater__/actions/call`

Route `auth=` protects the handler after the surface is accepted. If you reuse
the same function for surface and route auth, Quater still runs both calls. The
surface call sees the transport path, while route auth sees the actual route
path being executed.

## Approval

Approval is not auth. Auth identifies the caller. Approval confirms one
sensitive operation should run for that caller and that exact argument set.

```python
from quater import ApprovalRequest


async def approve_action(ctx: ApprovalRequest) -> bool:
    return ctx.auth is not None and ctx.token == "approve-ord_1001"
```

The approval request includes:

- action name
- SHA-256 argument hash
- submitted approval token
- authenticated subject when available
- request context

Quater computes the hash from the action name and canonical JSON arguments.
Object key ordering does not change it.

## Hosts And Proxies

Use `allowed_hosts` for deployed apps:

```python
app = Quater(allowed_hosts=["api.example.com"])
```

In strict mode, empty `allowed_hosts` accepts local development hosts only:

- `localhost`
- `127.0.0.1`
- `::1`
- `testserver`

`app.validate_production()` rejects missing `allowed_hosts` and rejects
`allowed_hosts=["*"]`.

Use `trusted_proxies` only for proxy IPs or CIDR ranges you control:

```python
app = Quater(
    allowed_hosts=["api.example.com"],
    trusted_proxies=["10.0.0.0/8"],
)
```

Quater ignores forwarded host and scheme headers unless the immediate client IP
matches `trusted_proxies`.

## Body Limits

`max_body_size` defaults to `2mb` and applies before JSON parsing or form
parsing:

```python
app = Quater(
    max_body_size="2mb",
    max_form_parts=1000,
    max_form_field_size="1mb",
    max_file_size="2mb",
)
```

If `Content-Length` exceeds the limit, Quater rejects the request before reading
the stream. If no content length exists, adapters enforce the limit while
reading the body.

Form and file limits apply after the request body fits inside `max_body_size`.
Set them through constructor options or environment variables such as
`QUATER_MAX_FILE_SIZE=8mb`.

Expected error:

```text
413 Payload Too Large
Payload Too Large
```

## Response Headers

Strict mode adds baseline headers to normal responses and framework errors:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` on HTTPS requests
- `Content-Security-Policy` when configured

Use `security="off"` only in controlled local or embedded environments.

## CORS And MCP Origins

CORS controls browser read access. It does not authenticate users.

```python
from quater import CORSConfig, Quater

app = Quater(
    cors=CORSConfig(
        allowed_origins=("https://app.example.com",),
        allowed_headers=("authorization", "content-type"),
        allow_credentials=True,
    )
)
```

If `allowed_headers` is empty, Quater reflects sanitized browser-requested
headers. If you configure headers, Quater only advertises those headers.
Quater advertises common API methods by default. If you register an
extension method with `route("PROPFIND", ...)` and browser clients call it
cross-origin, include that method in `allowed_methods`.

MCP origin validation uses `mcp_allowed_origins` first:

```python
app = Quater(
    mcp_allowed_origins=["https://client.example"],
    mcp_auth=authenticate,
)
```

If that option is empty and CORS has exact origins, Quater reuses those exact
origins. A CORS wildcard does not allow browser-based MCP calls.

## Signed Cookies

`SignedCookieSigner` signs small cookie values with HMAC. It does not encrypt
them.

```python
from quater import SignedCookieSigner

signer = SignedCookieSigner("new-secret", fallback_secrets=["old-secret"])
cookie_value = signer.sign("user_123")
subject = signer.verify(cookie_value)
```

Use fallback secrets during rotation. Verification uses constant-time signature
comparison.

## Request IDs And Access Logs

Quater validates `x-request-id` before echoing it. Unsafe values are replaced
with generated ids before the handler or access logger sees them.

`access_logger` receives structured metadata after the response is created. It
does not receive request bodies, headers, or query strings.

```python
from quater import AccessLogEvent, Quater


async def log_access(event: AccessLogEvent) -> None:
    print(event.to_dict())


app = Quater(access_logger=log_access)
```

If the access logger raises, Quater suppresses the exception so logging cannot
break the response path. If you need fail-closed audit behavior, use `mcp_audit`
for MCP tool calls.

## What Can Go Wrong

`Invalid Host header`
: Configure `allowed_hosts` or fix the incoming `Host` header.

`Invalid Content-Length header`
: Send a valid non-negative integer content length.

`CORS wildcard origins cannot be used with credentials`
: Use explicit origins when `allow_credentials=True`.

`Invalid MCP Origin`
: Add the client origin to `mcp_allowed_origins`.

`Production safety check failed:`
: Fix each listed item before production startup.

`Route path '/mcp' is reserved by Quater. Choose a different application route.`
: Do not register application routes under Quater protocol paths.
