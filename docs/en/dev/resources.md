# Resources And Injection

This page explains `app.state` and request-scoped `Resource` injection.

## Prerequisites

Read [Quickstart](/en/dev/quickstart) and [Public API](/en/dev/api). You
should know async context managers if you plan to inject database sessions.

## Why This Exists

Real handlers need values that should never come from the client: database
sessions, cache clients, tenant objects, feature flags, and API clients.

Quater keeps those values explicit:

- Long-lived objects live on `app.state`.
- Per-request values use `Resource`.
- Routes opt in by naming the `Resource`, either in the decorator's
  `inject={...}` map or in the parameter's type annotation.

Quater does not build a hidden dependency graph. A reader can see every injected
parameter at the route — in the decorator's `inject` map or in the handler
signature — and know which values come from the app.

## Resource Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    startup["your code: on_startup\ncreate long-lived pool"]
    state["framework: app.state\nholds pool/client/config"]
    request["framework: request starts"]
    provider["your code: Resource provider\ncreates request value"]
    handler["your code: handler\nreceives injected value"]
    response["framework: response created"]
    cleanup["framework: cleanup after response\nalso on errors"]
    shutdown["your code: on_shutdown\nclose long-lived pool"]

    startup --> state
    state --> request --> provider --> handler --> response --> cleanup
    state --> shutdown
```

Cleanup runs after response creation. For streaming responses, Quater keeps the
resource alive until the response body has been consumed by the adapter.

### One scope per request

Every request gets a single resource scope: one place that opens the values it
needs, caches them, and cleans them up. Two things follow from that.

First, the same `Resource` resolves once per request. If two parameters — or a
handler and, later, the rest of the request — ask for the same `Resource`
object, they get the same instance. A `Resource` that opens a database session
opens **one** session per request, not one per parameter.

Second, the scope is strictly per request. Nothing opened for one request is
ever visible to another, and when the request finishes, every resource it
opened is torn down once, in the reverse of the order it was opened. If a later
resource fails to open, the ones already open are still cleaned up.

The scope is lazy: a request whose handler injects nothing never creates one.

## A Runnable Example

```python
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator

from quater import Quater, Request, Resource


class OrderStore:
    async def get_order(self, order_id: str) -> dict[str, object]:
        return {"id": order_id, "status": "paid"}

    async def close(self) -> None:
        pass


app = Quater()


@app.on_startup
async def startup() -> None:
    app.state.store = OrderStore()


@app.on_shutdown
async def shutdown() -> None:
    await app.state.store.close()


async def store_resource(request: Request) -> AsyncIterator[OrderStore]:
    yield request.app.state.store


store = Resource(store_resource, name="store")


@app.get("/orders/{order_id}", inject={"store": store})
async def get_order(order_id: str, store: OrderStore) -> dict[str, object]:
    return await store.get_order(order_id)
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "id": "ord_1001",
  "status": "paid"
}
```

## Provider Forms

A provider can accept no arguments:

```python
async def settings_resource() -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"region": "us-east-1"}
```

Or it can accept the current `Request`:

```python
async def tenant_resource(request: Request) -> str:
    return request.headers.get("x-tenant-id", "public")
```

It can return:

- a plain value
- an awaitable value
- a sync context manager
- an async context manager
- a sync generator that yields once
- an async generator that yields once

Database sessions usually use an async generator:

```python
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator

from quater import Request


async def session_resource(request: Request) -> AsyncIterator[DatabaseSession]:
    async with request.app.state.database.session() as session:
        yield session
```

## Resources That Depend On Resources

A provider can ask for other resources, the same way a handler does — with
`Annotated[T, resource]`. Quater resolves each dependency first, once, from the
request's shared scope, and passes it in. The classic case is a current-user
resource that needs the database session to look the user up:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from quater import Request, Resource

db_session = Resource(session_resource, name="session")
SessionDep = Annotated[DatabaseSession, db_session]


async def current_user_provider(
    request: Request,
    session: SessionDep,
) -> User:
    user = await find_user(session, request.headers.get("authorization"))
    if user is None:
        raise UnauthorizedError
    return user


current_user = Resource(current_user_provider, name="current_user")
```

Because the session comes from the shared scope, the session opened to look up
the user is the *same* session a handler injects directly — one connection for
the whole request.

It stays explicit on purpose: a provider only receives a resource you point at
through its annotation. Nothing is guessed from a bare type. A provider
parameter that is neither named `request` nor annotated with a resource is
rejected when routes compile.

The dependency graph is checked at startup, not on the first request:

- A dependency cycle (a resource that needs itself, directly or through others)
  fails when routes compile.
- A provider parameter that can't be resolved fails when routes compile.

Dependencies are private to the provider: a resource and everything it depends
on stay out of OpenAPI, MCP, and CLI schemas. The session never shows up as a
tool input.

## Route Usage

```python
db_session = Resource(session_resource, name="db_session")


@app.post("/orders", inject={"session": db_session})
async def create_order(order: CreateOrder, session: DatabaseSession) -> dict[str, str]:
    created = await session.create_order(order)
    return {"id": created.id}
```

The injected `session` does not appear in:

- OpenAPI request parameters
- MCP input schemas
- CLI action schemas
- HTTP path, query, header, cookie, or body binding

That keeps app-owned objects away from untrusted caller input.

## Two Ways To Wire A Resource

A `Resource` is bound to a handler parameter by name. You can express that
binding in two places. Both produce the same binding, and both keep the
parameter out of every caller-facing schema.

### In the decorator (`inject={...}`)

The `inject` map keys each resource to a parameter name:

```python
@app.post("/orders", inject={"session": db_session})
async def create_order(order: CreateOrder, session: DatabaseSession) -> dict[str, str]:
    ...
```

The parameter (`session: DatabaseSession`) is a plain typed parameter; the
decorator says where its value comes from. This is the only form that a
[`RouteGroup`](#groups) can share across several routes, so prefer it when a
whole feature needs the same resource.

### In the type annotation (`Annotated[T, resource]`)

Put the `Resource` in the parameter's annotation. The parameter type is still
`T`; the resource rides along as annotation metadata that Quater reads at route
compilation:

```python
@app.post("/orders")
async def create_order(
    order: CreateOrder,
    session: Annotated[DatabaseSession, db_session],
) -> dict[str, str]:
    ...
```

This keeps the value and its provider next to the parameter, and it lets you
define a reusable alias once and share it across handlers — the same shape you
may know from other frameworks:

```python
from typing import Annotated

SessionDep = Annotated[DatabaseSession, db_session]


@app.get("/orders/{order_id}")
async def get_order(order_id: str, session: SessionDep) -> dict[str, str]:
    ...


@app.post("/orders")
async def create_order(order: CreateOrder, session: SessionDep) -> dict[str, str]:
    ...
```

Because the annotation type stays `DatabaseSession` and the parameter has no
default, this form type-checks cleanly under strict tools with no cast or
`# type: ignore`.

Define the `Resource` (and any `Annotated` alias) at module scope so Quater can
resolve the annotation when it compiles the route.

### Rules

- Declare a resource in **one** place per parameter. Naming the same parameter in
  both `inject={...}` and its annotation is rejected at route compilation.
- A `Resource` cannot go in a parameter's **default** value
  (`session: DatabaseSession = db_session`). Use `inject={...}` or the
  annotation instead; the default form is rejected with a clear error.

## Groups

Use a [`RouteGroup`](/en/dev/reference/application#symbol-routegroup) when
several routes in one feature need the same resource:

```python
from quater import Quater, Resource, RouteGroup

app = Quater()
orders = RouteGroup(prefix="/orders", inject={"session": db_session})


@orders.get("/{order_id}")
async def get_order(order_id: str, session: DatabaseSession) -> dict[str, object]:
    order = await session.fetch_order(order_id)
    return {"id": order.id}


app.include(orders)
```

Quater flattens group resources into the final route when the group is included.
It does not resolve resources during route matching.

## MCP And CLI

Resources work the same through HTTP, MCP, local CLI, and remote CLI:

```python
@app.get(
    "/orders/{order_id}",
    tool=True,
    cli=True,
    inject={"session": db_session},
    description="Fetch one order.",
)
async def get_order(order_id: str, session: DatabaseSession) -> dict[str, object]:
    order = await session.fetch_order(order_id)
    return {"id": order.id, "status": order.status}
```

The generated MCP and CLI schemas include `order_id`, not `session`.

## What Can Go Wrong

`Injected parameter 'session' does not exist on the handler`
: The `inject` key must match a handler parameter name.

`Injected parameter 'session' cannot use a parameter marker`
: Do not combine `Resource` injection with `Path`, `Query`, `Body`, `Header`, or
  `Cookie`.

`Resource provider 'current_user' parameter 'mystery' could not be resolved: name it 'request' or annotate it with Annotated[T, resource]`
: A provider parameter is neither named `request` nor annotated with a resource.
  Name it `request`, annotate it `Annotated[T, some_resource]`, or remove it.

`Resource dependency cycle detected: a -> b -> a`
: A resource depends on itself, directly or through others. Break the loop.

`Resource provider parameter 'request' cannot be both the request and a resource`
: A parameter is named `request` and also annotated with a resource. Pick one.

`Resource providers may accept the request only once`
: A provider lists more than one request parameter. Keep a single one.

`Resource providers cannot use *args or **kwargs`
: Give the provider explicit parameters: `request` and/or resource dependencies.

`Resource provider 'db_session' did not yield a value`
: A generator provider must yield exactly one value.

`Resource provider 'db_session' yielded more than once`
: Use one `yield`, then cleanup after it.

`Duplicate injected parameter: session`
: A group and a route both define `session` with different `Resource` objects.
  Use the same object or rename one parameter.

`Injected parameter 'session' is declared both in inject= and in its type annotation`
: A parameter names the same resource in the decorator `inject` map and in its
  `Annotated[...]` metadata. Keep one.

`Resource for 'session' must be declared in inject= or in the type annotation (Annotated[T, resource]), not as a default value`
: A `Resource` was placed in a parameter's default value. Move it into the
  `inject` map or the parameter's annotation.

`Only one resource is supported in a type annotation`
: A parameter's `Annotated[...]` metadata lists more than one `Resource`. Use a
  single resource per parameter.
