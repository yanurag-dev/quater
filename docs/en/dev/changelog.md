# Changelog / Release Notes

This page records public release notes for Quater.

## Prerequisites

Read [Stability](/en/dev/stability) before depending on the pre-release API.

## 0.1.0a2

This alpha tightens fail-fast validation around auth headers, CORS, and
production-facing config.

### Fixed

- Added duplicate `Authorization` and `Proxy-Authorization` header validation
  before auth hooks run.
- Added CORS `allowed_methods` validation during configuration and included
  `HEAD` in the default CORS method set.
- Added validation for single-string and non-string values in list-like config
  fields before app startup.
- Added malformed `Cookie` header handling that returns `400 Bad Request`.
- Added malformed bracketed `Host` header validation before route auth runs.

## 0.1.0a1

This is the first alpha release shape for evaluation.

### Added

- `Quater` application object with RSGI, ASGI, and WSGI adapters.
- Typed route decorators for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and custom
  methods.
- Path, query, header, cookie, and JSON body binding.
- `msgspec` JSON serialization and validation.
- Route-level auth with `auth=`.
- MCP tools with `tool=True`, `mcp_auth`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.
- Human-readable MCP docs at `/mcp/docs`.
- CLI actions with `cli=True`, local execution, remote execution, dry-run, and
  approval hooks.
- Generated OpenAPI JSON and Swagger UI.
- `Resource` injection and `app.state`.
- Route groups that flatten at startup.
- In-process `TestClient` and `MCPTestClient`.
- CORS, allowed-host checks, body limits, security headers, request IDs, signed
  cookies, and production safety checks.
