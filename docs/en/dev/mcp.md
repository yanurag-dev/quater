# MCP Tools

This page explains how Quater exposes selected backend operations as MCP tools
for AI agents.

## Prerequisites

Read the [Quickstart](/en/dev/quickstart) and create an app with `mcp_auth`.
You should understand route `auth=` before exposing sensitive tools.

## What MCP Means Here

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that lets AI clients discover tools
and call them with structured arguments. Quater exposes route-backed tools over
HTTP so an agent can call backend operations without a separate tool server.
Read the protocol background at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

The important idea is directness with boundaries. An agent should not need to
click through a frontend to fetch an order, update a workflow, or run an
approved backend action. It should call a described tool with typed inputs, and
your app should decide whether that call is allowed.

Quater does not make every route a tool. You opt in with `tool=True`, write a
description, and protect the MCP transport with `mcp_auth`.

## A Runnable Tool

```python
from quater import AuthContext, AuthRequest, Quater, Request


async def authenticate(ctx: AuthRequest) -> AuthContext | None:
    if ctx.headers.get("authorization") != "Bearer mcp-token":
        return None
    return AuthContext(subject="agent_123")


app = Quater(
    mcp_auth=authenticate,
    mcp_allowed_origins=["https://client.example"],
)


@app.get(
    "/orders/{order_id}",
    tool=True,
    auth=authenticate,
    description="Fetch one order by id.",
)
async def get_order(order_id: str, request: Request) -> dict[str, object]:
    assert request.auth is not None
    return {"order_id": order_id, "subject": request.auth.subject}
```

The route still works as HTTP:

```text
GET /orders/ord_1001
```

It also appears in MCP `tools/list`.

## Auth Layering

MCP auth has two independent gates:

- `mcp_auth` protects `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `/mcp/docs`.
- Route `auth=` protects the handler after the tool call resolves to a route.

Quater checks MCP auth on each HTTP request. It does not authenticate once during
`initialize` and then reuse that result for later tool calls.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP client
    participant Quater as Quater MCP transport
    participant MCPAuth as your mcp_auth
    participant RouteAuth as your route auth=
    participant Handler as your handler

    Client->>Quater: POST /mcp tools/call
    Quater->>MCPAuth: AuthRequest(source="mcp")
    MCPAuth-->>Quater: AuthContext or None
    Quater->>RouteAuth: AuthRequest(path="/orders/{order_id}")
    RouteAuth-->>Quater: AuthContext or None
    Quater->>Handler: get_order(order_id, request)
    Handler-->>Client: JSON-RPC result
```

If either hook returns `None`, the call fails. When both use the same function,
Quater still calls the function twice because the transport and route are
different boundaries.

## Endpoint And Client Config

The MCP endpoint is fixed:

```text
POST /mcp
```

For a hosted app at `https://api.example.com`, configure the MCP URL as:

```text
https://api.example.com/mcp
```

Bearer auth must go on every HTTP request, not only on `initialize`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "store": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mcp-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`initialize` is not a login. Quater does not create a server-side session from
it. If the token expires, the next request fails with `401 Unauthorized`.

::: tip Why the route may also have `auth=`
`mcp_auth` decides whether the caller can use the MCP surface. Route `auth=`
decides whether that caller can run the selected backend operation. Use both for
sensitive tools.

## Request Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    request["framework: POST /mcp"]
    origin["framework: origin check"]
    auth["your code: mcp_auth"]
    dispatch["framework: JSON-RPC dispatch"]
    list["framework: tools/list"]
    call["framework: tools/call"]
    route_auth["your code: route auth="]
    bind["framework: bind arguments"]
    approval["your code: approval hook when needed"]
    handler["your code: handler"]
    result["framework: JSON-RPC response"]

    request --> origin --> auth --> dispatch
    dispatch --> list --> result
    dispatch --> call --> route_auth --> bind --> approval --> handler --> result
```

Browser MCP clients also need `mcp_allowed_origins`. If you omit it and CORS has
exact origins, Quater reuses those exact origins. A CORS wildcard does not allow
browser-based MCP calls.

## Tool Schemas

Quater generates `inputSchema` from the route's path, query, header, cookie, and
body parameters. `Form` fields appear as scalar tool arguments. It excludes
injected `Resource` parameters because those values belong to the app, not the
caller.

```json
{
  "name": "get_order",
  "description": "Fetch one order by id.",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "order_id": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["order_id"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

Descriptions are required for `tool=True` routes. Use `description=` or the
first line of the handler docstring. Tool descriptions are visible to agents, so
write them as instructions about when the tool should be used.

Routes with `File` parameters cannot be MCP tools in this release. File upload
through an agent needs a separate file-reference design and tighter trust rules,
so Quater fails at startup instead of exposing a tool schema that cannot run
safely.

## Approval-Protected Tools

Use `needs_approval=True` when auth alone should not run an operation.

```python
from quater import ApprovalRequest, AuthContext, AuthRequest, Quater


async def authenticate(ctx: AuthRequest) -> AuthContext | None:
    if ctx.headers.get("authorization") != "Bearer mcp-token":
        return None
    return AuthContext(subject="agent_123")


async def approve_action(ctx: ApprovalRequest) -> bool:
    return ctx.token == "approve-ord_1001"


app = Quater(mcp_auth=authenticate, action_approval=approve_action)


@app.patch(
    "/orders/{order_id}/status",
    tool=True,
    needs_approval=True,
    description="Update an order status.",
)
async def update_order_status(order_id: str, status: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"order_id": order_id, "status": status}
```

Send the approval token in MCP `_meta`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "update_order_status",
    "arguments": {
      "order_id": "ord_1001",
      "status": "shipped"
    },
    "_meta": {
      "approvalToken": "approve-ord_1001"
    }
  }
}
```

If the token is missing, Quater returns a JSON-RPC error with
`data.code == "approval_required"` and includes `arguments_hash`.

## MCP Docs

`GET /mcp/docs` renders a human-readable page with:

- tool name
- description
- route method and path
- pretty JSON input and output schema
- example `tools/call` payload

MCP clients should use `tools/list`. Humans should use `/mcp/docs`.

Disable the page while keeping `/mcp` available:

```python
app = Quater(mcp_auth=authenticate, mcp_docs_path=None)
```

## Auditing

Pass `mcp_audit` to receive redacted tool-call events:

```python
from quater import ToolAuditEvent


async def audit(event: ToolAuditEvent) -> None:
    print(event.tool_name, event.subject, event.success)


app = Quater(mcp_auth=authenticate, mcp_audit=audit)
```

Quater redacts argument values before the hook sees them. If the audit hook
raises, Quater returns a JSON-RPC internal error for that tool call. It does not
silently hide audit failures.

## What Can Go Wrong

`MCP tools require mcp_auth`
: Add `mcp_auth=...` before registering any `tool=True` route.

`Invalid MCP Origin`
: Add the browser origin to `mcp_allowed_origins`.

`Unsupported protocol version`
: Send a supported `MCP-Protocol-Version` header or omit it and let Quater use
  its default.

`Tool not found`
: Check the route has `tool=True` and a description.

`Routes with File parameters cannot be exposed as MCP tools`
: Keep upload routes HTTP-only today, or split the upload from the operation an
  agent should call.

`approval_required`
: Send `_meta.approvalToken` or remove `needs_approval=True` from that route.
