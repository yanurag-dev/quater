# Public API

This is the surface Quater expects application code to use during the current
pre-release. Everything else can still move while the framework settles.

This page explains the public surface in human terms. For generated signatures
and class members, use the [Reference](/en/latest/reference/).

Use top-level imports for normal app code:

```python
from quater import (
    ActionApproval,
    AccessLogEvent,
    AccessLogHook,
    AppConfig,
    ApprovalRequest,
    AuthContext,
    AuthRequest,
    BytesResponse,
    CORSConfig,
    EmptyResponse,
    HTMLResponse,
    HTTPError,
    ImproperlyConfigured,
    JSONResponse,
    MCPTestClient,
    Quater,
    RedirectResponse,
    Request,
    Response,
    RouteGroup,
    SignedCookieSigner,
    StreamResponse,
    TestClient,
    TestResponse,
    TextResponse,
    ToolAuditEvent,
)
```

## App

`Quater()` is the application object.

```python
app = Quater(
    allowed_hosts=["api.example.com"],
    max_body_size="2mb",
    docs_path="/docs",
    openapi_path="/openapi.json",
    mcp_docs_path="/mcp/docs",
    mcp_auth=authenticate,
    cli_auth=authenticate,
    access_logger=log_access,
)
```

The snippet assumes you already defined `authenticate` and `log_access`. For an
app with no MCP tools, omit `mcp_auth`. For an app with no CLI actions, omit
`cli_auth`.

Documented constructor options:

- `name`
- `config`
- `debug`
- `security`
- `allowed_hosts`
- `trusted_proxies`
- `max_body_size`
- `cors`
- `content_security_policy`
- `docs_path`
- `openapi_path`
- `mcp_docs_path`
- `mcp_allowed_origins`
- `mcp_auth`
- `mcp_audit`
- `cli_auth`
- `action_approval`
- `access_logger`
- `request_id_header`

The MCP JSON-RPC endpoint is always `/mcp`. There is no `mcp_path` option. If
an app exposes tools, `mcp_auth` is required.

If an app exposes `cli=True` routes, `cli_auth` is required. If any exposed
route uses `needs_approval=True`, `action_approval` is required.

Before deploying through a server command that does not use `quater run`, call
`app.validate_production()` after routes are declared. It compiles routes and
fails fast on unsafe production settings such as `debug=True`, disabled
security, or missing `allowed_hosts`. See [Deployment](/en/latest/deployment)
for server examples.

## Routes

Route decorators are the main API:

```python
@app.get("/items/{id:int}")
async def get_item(id: int) -> dict[str, int]:
    return {"id": id}
```

Available decorators:

- `app.get`
- `app.post`
- `app.put`
- `app.patch`
- `app.delete`
- `app.route`

Documented decorator options:

- `name`
- `description`
- `tool`
- `cli`
- `needs_approval`
- `auth`
- `metadata`
- `before`
- `after`
- `around`
- `exception_handlers`

`tool=True` exposes the route through MCP. Tool routes must have a useful
description, either through `description=` or the handler docstring. The app
must also be created with `mcp_auth`.

`cli=True` exposes the route through Quater actions. CLI action routes also need
a useful description and the app must be created with `cli_auth`.

`needs_approval=True` can be used with `tool=True` or `cli=True`. It requires an
`action_approval` hook on the app.

Quater reserves its own protocol paths. User routes cannot be registered under
`/mcp`, under `/mcp/...`, at `/.well-known/quater-actions.json`, or under
`/__quater__/...`.

## Route Groups

[`RouteGroup`](/en/latest/reference/application#symbol-routegroup) keeps feature
routes together while still compiling down to normal Quater routes.

```python
from quater import Quater, RouteGroup

app = Quater()
orders = RouteGroup(prefix="/orders", tags=["orders"])


@orders.get("/{order_id}", description="Fetch one order.")
async def get_order(order_id: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"order_id": order_id}


app.include(orders)
```

Documented group constructor options:

- `prefix`
- `tags`
- `auth`
- `metadata`
- `before`
- `after`
- `around`
- `exception_handlers`

Groups expose the same route decorators as the app: `get`, `post`, `put`,
`patch`, `delete`, and `route`.

You can nest groups:

```python
api = RouteGroup(prefix="/api", tags=["api"])
orders = RouteGroup(prefix="/orders", tags=["orders"])

api.include(orders)
app.include(api)
```

The route `orders.get("/{order_id}")` becomes `/api/orders/{order_id}`.

Define routes before including a group in the app. `app.include(group)` validates
the flattened routes for exposure settings and reserved framework paths before
registering anything, then locks the group. A group cannot be included twice,
reused under two parents, or modified after it has been included.

Merge rules are intentionally simple:

- Parent prefixes are joined before child prefixes and route paths.
- Parent metadata is copied first, then child metadata, then route metadata.
- Tags are appended in order and de-duplicated.
- Group auth runs before route auth. If either returns `None`, the request is
  denied.
- Group `before` and `around` middleware run before route middleware.
- Route `after` middleware runs before group `after` middleware.
- Route exception handlers are tried before group exception handlers.

Group auth and middleware apply to normal HTTP requests and to the same route
when it is exposed with `tool=True` or `cli=True`. This is important for
AI-facing and operator-facing routes: a tool or action should not quietly bypass
the feature-level policy that protects the HTTP endpoint.

## Request And Context

Use [`Request`](/en/latest/reference/request#symbol-request) when the handler
needs headers, body access, auth, or the call source.

```python
@app.get("/whoami")
async def whoami(request: Request) -> dict[str, object]:
    return {
        "source": request.context.source,
        "entrypoint": request.context.entrypoint,
        "tool": request.context.tool_name,
    }
```

`request.context.source` is:

- `"api"` for normal HTTP calls.
- `"mcp"` for MCP protocol requests such as `initialize` and `tools/list`.
- `"cli"` for Quater CLI action calls.

`request.context.entrypoint` is:

- `"server"` for calls handled by the running server, including normal API
  calls, MCP calls, and remote CLI calls.
- `"local"` for in-process local CLI calls that import the app directly.

`request.context.tool_name` is set for MCP tool calls.
`request.context.action_name` is set for MCP tool calls and CLI action calls.
`request.context.request_id` is set for every handled request.

## Request IDs And Access Logs

Quater reads `x-request-id` by default, validates that it is safe to echo, and
adds the final id to the response. If the incoming value is missing or unsafe,
Quater generates a new id. Set `request_id_header=None` to stop writing a
request-id response header.

Use `access_logger` with
[`AccessLogEvent`](/en/latest/reference/observability#symbol-accesslogevent)
when you want one structured event after each handled server request:

```python
from quater import AccessLogEvent, Quater


async def log_access(event: AccessLogEvent) -> None:
    print(event.to_dict())


app = Quater(access_logger=log_access)
```

The event includes method, path, status code, duration, source, entrypoint,
client, request id, and the current tool/action name when there is one. It does
not include request headers, body, or query-string values.

## Auth

Auth hooks receive
[`AuthRequest`](/en/latest/reference/auth#symbol-authrequest) and return
[`AuthContext`](/en/latest/reference/auth#symbol-authcontext) or `None`.

```python
async def authenticate(ctx: AuthRequest) -> AuthContext | None:
    if ctx.headers.get("authorization") != "Bearer demo-token":
        return None
    return AuthContext(subject="demo-user")
```

Attach the hook per route:

```python
@app.get("/me", auth=authenticate)
async def me(request: Request) -> dict[str, str]:
    assert request.auth is not None
    return {"subject": request.auth.subject}
```

For MCP tools, the same hook can also be passed as `mcp_auth`:

```python
app = Quater(mcp_auth=authenticate)
```

`mcp_auth` protects MCP protocol requests and `/mcp/docs`. Route `auth=` still
protects individual handlers. If both point to the same function, Quater still
runs route auth against the handler route so path-based policies cannot be
accidentally skipped.

For CLI actions, pass an auth hook as `cli_auth`:

```python
app = Quater(cli_auth=authenticate)
```

`cli_auth` protects local action discovery, local action execution, remote
action discovery, and remote action execution. Route `auth=` still protects
individual handlers.

## Actions and Approval

Use `cli=True` for routes that should be callable from the Quater CLI:

```python
app = Quater(cli_auth=authenticate)


@app.get("/orders/{order_id}", cli=True, description="Fetch one order by id.")
async def get_order(order_id: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"order_id": order_id}
```

Use `needs_approval=True` for exposed actions that require a second check before
execution:

```python
from quater import ApprovalRequest, Quater


async def approve_action(ctx: ApprovalRequest) -> bool:
    return ctx.token == "approve-local"


app = Quater(
    cli_auth=authenticate,
    action_approval=approve_action,
)


@app.patch(
    "/orders/{order_id}/status",
    cli=True,
    needs_approval=True,
    description="Update an order status.",
)
async def update_order_status(order_id: str, status: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"order_id": order_id, "status": status}
```

[`ApprovalRequest`](/en/latest/reference/auth#symbol-approvalrequest) includes:

- `action`
- `arguments_hash`
- `token`
- `auth`
- `context`

Quater validates action arguments before calling the approval hook. Dry-run
returns the same argument hash without calling the handler or approval hook.

## Responses

Use [response objects](/en/latest/reference/responses) when you need explicit
status, headers, content type, or streaming:

```python
from quater import JSONResponse, StreamResponse, TextResponse
```

Plain return values still cover the common case:

- `dict`, `list`, `tuple`, `bool`, `int`, and `float` become JSON.
- dataclass instances and `msgspec.Struct` instances become JSON.
- `str` becomes [`TextResponse`](/en/latest/reference/responses#symbol-textresponse).
- `bytes` becomes [`BytesResponse`](/en/latest/reference/responses#symbol-bytesresponse).
- `None` becomes `204 No Content`.

## Testing

Use [`TestClient`](/en/latest/reference/testing#symbol-testclient) to test a
Quater app in process. It calls `app.handle()` directly, so tests do not need
Granian, ASGI, WSGI, or a listening port.

```python
from quater import Quater, TestClient

app = Quater()


@app.get("/health")
async def health() -> dict[str, bool]:
    return {"ok": True}


async def test_health() -> None:
    async with TestClient(app) as client:
        response = await client.get("/health")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"ok": True}
```

The async context manager runs startup and shutdown hooks. The client keeps a
small cookie jar, supports `params=`, `headers=`, `cookies=`, `json=`, and
`content=`, and collects streaming responses into `response.body`.

MCP helpers are available under `client.mcp`. The attribute is an
[`MCPTestClient`](/en/latest/reference/testing#symbol-mcptestclient); most tests
should use it through
[`TestClient`](/en/latest/reference/testing#symbol-testclient) instead of
constructing it directly.

```python
response = await client.mcp.tools_call(
    "get_user",
    {"id": 7},
    token="demo-token",
    origin="https://client.example",
)
```

For testing patterns across auth, cookies, streams, and MCP tools, read the
[Testing guide](/en/latest/testing).

## Config Helpers

[`CORSConfig`](/en/latest/reference/application#symbol-corsconfig) is the public
CORS helper:

```python
app = Quater(
    cors=CORSConfig(allowed_origins=("https://app.example.com",)),
)
```

[`AppConfig`](/en/latest/reference/application#symbol-appconfig) is useful when
several app instances should share one base config:

```python
base = AppConfig(allowed_hosts=("api.example.com",))
app = Quater(config=base)
```

[`ImproperlyConfigured`](/en/latest/reference/auth#symbol-improperlyconfigured)
is raised when Quater detects invalid framework setup. `ConfigurationError`
still exists in `quater.exceptions` for compatibility, and it is a subclass of
`ImproperlyConfigured`.

[`SignedCookieSigner`](/en/latest/reference/auth#symbol-signedcookiesigner)
signs small cookie values with HMAC:

```python
signer = SignedCookieSigner("new-secret", fallback_secrets=["old-secret"])
cookie_value = signer.sign("user_123")
```

## MCP Audit

Use [`ToolAuditEvent`](/en/latest/reference/observability#symbol-toolauditevent)
to type an audit hook:

```python
async def audit(event: ToolAuditEvent) -> None:
    print(event.tool_name, event.subject, event.success)


app = Quater(
    mcp_auth=authenticate,
    mcp_audit=audit,
)
```

Tool arguments are redacted before they reach the hook.
If the audit hook raises, the MCP call returns a JSON-RPC internal error instead
of hiding the failure.

## Import Boundary

Application code should normally import from `quater`:

```python
from quater import Quater, Request
```

The public import rules are documented in [Stability](/en/latest/stability).
In short: top-level `quater` exports are the normal app API, a few advanced
compatibility modules are supported, and the rest of `quater.*` is internal.

Avoid imports such as `quater.app`, `quater.router`, `quater.docs.*`, and
`quater.tools.registry` in application code. Those modules are framework
implementation details, even when their names look useful.
